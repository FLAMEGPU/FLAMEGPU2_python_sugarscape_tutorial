    "This is a tutorial for FLAME GPU. An open-source piece of software for the simulation of complex systems. It is domain-independent and can be used for any simulation that uses the idea of agent-based modelling. The agent-based modelling approach of describing individual behaviours and observing the emergent outputs enables FLAME GPU to be used for a wide range of examples such as flocking, cellular biology, and transportation. This tutorial focuses on the classical Sugascape model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the tutorial is to introduce the software and the modelling abstraction (API). The software aims to hide the underlying complexities of the GPU such as data structures and even parallelism. That said their are important considerations when moving from a serial modelling methodology to a parallel one which are presented and explained during this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAME GPU is developed in C++ but has a Python front end. This tutorial uses Python to define both the model description and the agent functions. There is an extensive set of user guidens and code documentation availabel for FLAME GPU which you can use alongside this tutorial for help: [https://docs.flamegpu.com/](https://docs.flamegpu.com/)\n",

    "For the purpose of this tutorial, the Jupyter notebook has been configured to work with FLAME GPU 2. The Jupyter notebook is a web based environment for interactive computing. It is capable of running code in a wide variety of programming languages. The notebook consists of cells which can be of type code or markdown (by default, new cells are created as code cells). You can execute the content of code cells by clicking the Run button. Cells which are actively running code will show a '*' symbol (or 'Play' icon in Colab) and cells which have completed will show a number indicating the position in which the cell was execute (or a green tick in Colab).\n",

    "The cell below is a simple example of a code cell. Clicking on the play button which appears when hovering over the cell with the mouse will run the code and you should see \"Hello!\" displayed beneath the code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some known limitations when running on Windows. E.g. Any errors during compilation of agent functions will be directed to the console which launched the Jupyter notebook rather than displayed in the notebook itself. See 'release notes' in the tutorial [README.md](README.md).  "

    "## Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sugarscape model is a classical agent based model where agents compete for resources within a grid world. It was first proposed by Epstein and Axtell in their book 'Growing Artifical Societies'. The variant of the model that we will work with in this tutorial is equivalent to the model described in chapter 2 which is the same as the 'Sugarscape 2 constant growback' model within NetLogo. It is also used as a benchmark example in the paper 'FLAME GPU 2: Flexible Large Scale Agent Based Simulation on GPUs'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this model, $N$ Sugarscape agents occupy a 2D grid environment of `cells`. Each cell contains a level of sugar $s$ which has a maximum value of $W_{max}$. The grid wraps so as to form a torus shaped environment without boundaries. At each time-step sugar grows back within a cell at a rate of $\\alpha$. Agents have a fixed vision distance of $V$ cells in the north, south, east and west directions as well as a sugar wealth, $w$, which represents a quantity of obtained sugar. Within this tutorial all agents have a fixed vision $V=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Sugarscape model is an interesting choice to learn FLAME GPU as it introduces a form of 'conflict' which is not present within the serial version. E.g. \n",
    "Within the serial implementation of this model, at each time-step the order of agents is randomised so that sequentially, each agent can choose to move to a new empty cell, with a preference for cells where there is a higher quantity of sugar available than their current location. If there are multiple potential cells which an agent could move to, then one is chosen from the candidate cells at random. Upon moving to a new cell, or if an agent remains stationary, the agent consumes all of the sugar at the agent's current location and decreases its own sugar wealth by a metabolism $m$ . If at this stage the agents sugar wealth is not greater than zero it dies and is removed from the simulation. \n",

    "![Sugarscape visualisation](./images/sugarscape_visualisation_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Implementation within FLAME GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this tutorial we will consider both Sugarscape agents and empty environment cells as agents. This makes modelling sense, as empty cells within the environment have their own behaviour in the form of sugar growback. Each aspect of the model implementation will be explained as we progress through the tutorial. "

All agent functions are compiled with a FLAME GPU device API which provides the mechanisms to query agent variables, messages and the environment.

    "Submodels within FLAME GPU exist as a mechanism to resolve conflicts which may naturally occur within the modelling abstraction. Within the Sugarscape model, conflict occurs as a result of agent movement but can occur within models for a wide range of reasons where there is any form of competition. (e.g. in chemical bonding, enforcing of mechanical constraints, etc). Consider within the Sugarscape model an agent function that attempts to allow the agents to move. First it would have to read a message from any neighbouring cells to understand the sugar distribution within the environment and then the agent would attempt to move to areas of high sugar concentration. Within a parallel modelling framework like FLAME GPU it is highly likely that multiple agents attempting to move simultaneously would result in agents occupying the same space, competing for sugar within the same cell. The original implementation of the model avoids this conflict as each agent executes its behaviour in serial with the order randomised for fairness. Whilst  serialisation is effective it is very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submodel approach allows a process to occur in which Sugarscape agents will negotiate to move fairly without collisions by respecting a randomly assigned priority. Each iteration of the submodel will allow agents to move. Within the model a function is used to output the cell status, agents then bid to move advertising their priority, the cells consider the requests and respond to confirm movement of the agent with highest priority. The highest priority agent receives this response and can ensure it has left the cell it currently occupies. If an agent is unable to move due to a higher priority agent taking precedence, then the submodel will run again, until either all agents have had the opportunity to move or the maximum number of movement attempts is exceeded (there is a upper bound of 9 attempts which is rarely reached but represents an agent attempting to move to every neighbouring cell). \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of agent collision is shown on the right hand side of the figure below using a simplistic two agent example. In this case, each agent initially requests to move to the same cell location. The cell responds by selecting the agent with highest priority therefore  allowing a single agent to move in the first iteration of the model. An exit condition only allows the main simulation to resume once all agents are *resolved* and as such a second iteration of the sub-model is required for the second agent to find a collision free location. The function dependency graph of the submodel showing its dependency to the `metabolise` function is shown on the left of the image below (the `growback` and `move` functions from the main model are omitted).\n",
